Computes the (partial) pivoted cholesky decomposition of `matrix`.

``` python
tfp.experimental.substrates.numpy.math.linalg.pivoted_cholesky(
    matrix,
    max_rank,
    diag_rtol=0.001,
    name=None
)
```



<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

The pivoted Cholesky is a low rank approximation of the Cholesky decomposition
of `matrix`, i.e. as described in [(Harbrecht et al., 2012)][1]. The
currently-worst-approximated diagonal element is selected as the pivot at each
iteration. This yields from a `[B1...Bn, N, N]` shaped `matrix` a `[B1...Bn,
N, K]` shaped rank-`K` approximation `lr` such that `lr @ lr.T ~= matrix`.
Note that, unlike the Cholesky decomposition, `lr` is not triangular even in
a rectangular-matrix sense. However, under a permutation it could be made
triangular (it has one more zero in each column as you move to the right).

Such a matrix can be useful as a preconditioner for conjugate gradient
optimization, i.e. as in [(Wang et al. 2019)][2], as matmuls and solves can be
cheaply done via the Woodbury matrix identity, as implemented by
`tf.linalg.LinearOperatorLowRankUpdate`.

#### Args:


* <b>`matrix`</b>: Floating point `Tensor` batch of symmetric, positive definite
  matrices.
* <b>`max_rank`</b>: Scalar `int` `Tensor`, the rank at which to truncate the
  approximation.
* <b>`diag_rtol`</b>: Scalar floating point `Tensor` (same dtype as `matrix`). If the
  errors of all diagonal elements of `lr @ lr.T` are each lower than
  `element * diag_rtol`, iteration is permitted to terminate early.
* <b>`name`</b>: Optional name for the op.


#### Returns:


* <b>`lr`</b>: Low rank pivoted Cholesky approximation of `matrix`.
