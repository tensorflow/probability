# tfp.distributions.SeedStream

## Class `SeedStream`



Local PRNG for amplifying seed entropy into seeds for base operations.

Writing sampling code which correctly sets the pseudo-random number
generator (PRNG) seed is surprisingly difficult.  This class serves as
a helper for the TensorFlow Probability coding pattern designed to
avoid common mistakes.

# Motivating Example

A common first-cut implementation of a sampler for the beta
distribution is to compute the ratio of a gamma with itself plus
another gamma.  This code snippet tries to do that, but contains a
surprisingly common error:

```python
def broken_beta(shape, alpha, beta, seed):
  x = tf.random_gamma(shape, alpha, seed=seed)
  y = tf.random_gamma(shape, beta, seed=seed)
  return x / (x + y)
```

The mistake is that the two gamma draws are seeded with the same
seed.  This causes them to always produce the same results, which,
in turn, leads this code snippet to always return `0.5`.  Because it
can happen across abstraction boundaries, this kind of error is
surprisingly easy to make when handling immutable seeds.

# Goals

TensorFlow Probability adopts a code style designed to eliminate the
above class of error, without exacerbating others.  The goals of
this code style are:

- Support reproducibility of results (by encouraging seeding of all
  pseudo-random operations).

- Avoid shared-write global state (by not relying on a global PRNG).

- Prevent accidental seed reuse by TF Probability implementers.  This
  goal is served with the local pseudo-random seed generator provided
  in this module.

- Mitigate potential accidental seed reuse by TF Probability clients
  (with a salting scheme).

- Prevent accidental resonances with downstream PRNGs (by hashing the
  output).

## Non-goals

- Implementing a high-performance PRNG for generating large amounts of
  entropy.  That's the job of the underlying TensorFlow PRNG we are
  seeding.

- Avoiding random seed collisions, aka "birthday attacks".

# Code pattern

```python
def random_beta(shape, alpha, beta, seed):        # (a)
  seed = SeedStream(seed, salt="random_beta")     # (b)
  x = tf.random_gamma(shape, alpha, seed=seed())  # (c)
  y = tf.random_gamma(shape, beta, seed=seed())   # (c)
  return x / (x + y)
```

The elements of this pattern are:

- Accept an explicit seed (line a) as an argument in all public
  functions, and write the function to be deterministic (up to any
  numerical issues) for fixed seed.

  - Rationale: This provides the client with the ability to reproduce
    results.  Accepting an immutable seed rather than a mutable PRNG
    object reduces code coupling, permitting different sections to be
    reproducible independently.

- Use that seed only to initialize a local `SeedStream` instance (line b).

  - Rationale: Avoids accidental seed reuse.

- Supply the name of the function being implemented as a salt to the
  `SeedStream` instance (line b).  This serves to keep the salts
  unique; unique salts ensure that clients of TF Probability will see
  different functions always produce independent results even if
  called with the same seeds.

- Seed each callee operation with the output of a unique call to the
  `SeedStream` instance (lines c).  This ensures reproducibility of
  results while preventing seed reuse across callee invocations.

# Why salt?

Salting the `SeedStream` instances (with unique salts) is defensive
programming against a client accidentally committing a mistake
similar to our motivating example.  Consider the following situation
that might arise without salting:

```python
def tfp_foo(seed):
  seed = SeedStream(seed, salt="")
  foo_stuff = tf.random_normal(seed=seed())
  ...

def tfp_bar(seed):
  seed = SeedStream(seed, salt="")
  bar_stuff = tf.random_normal(seed=seed())
  ...

def client_baz(seed):
  foo = tfp_foo(seed=seed)
  bar = tfp_bar(seed=seed)
  ...
```

The client should have used different seeds as inputs to `foo` and
`bar`.  However, because they didn't, *and because `foo` and `bar`
both sample a Gaussian internally as their first action*, the
internal `foo_stuff` and `bar_stuff` will be the same, and the
returned `foo` and `bar` will not be independent, leading to subtly
incorrect answers from the client's simulation.  This kind of bug is
particularly insidious for the client, because it depends on a
Distributions implementation detail, namely the order in which `foo`
and `bar` invoke the samplers they depend on.  In particular, a
Bayesflow team member can introduce such a bug in previously
(accidentally) correct client code by performing an internal
refactoring that causes this operation order alignment.

A salting discipline eliminates this problem by making sure that the
seeds seen by `foo`'s callees will differ from those seen by `bar`'s
callees, even if `foo` and `bar` are invoked with the same input
seed.

<h2 id="__init__"><code>__init__</code></h2>

``` python
__init__(
    seed,
    salt
)
```

Initializes a `SeedStream`.

#### Args:

* <b>`seed`</b>: Any Python object convertible to string, supplying the
    initial entropy.  If `None`, operations seeded with seeds
    drawn from this `SeedStream` will follow TensorFlow semantics
    for not being seeded.
* <b>`salt`</b>: Any Python object convertible to string, supplying
    auxiliary entropy.  Must be unique across the Distributions
    and TensorFlow Probability code base.  See class docstring for
    rationale.

## Methods

<h3 id="__call__"><code>__call__</code></h3>

``` python
__call__()
```

Returns a fresh integer usable as a seed in downstream operations.

If this `SeedStream` was initialized with `seed=None`, returns
`None`.  This has the effect that downstream operations (both
`SeedStream`s and primitive TensorFlow ops) will behave as though
they were unseeded.

The returned integer is non-negative, and uniformly distributed in
the half-open interval `[0, 2**512)`.  This is consistent with
TensorFlow, as TensorFlow operations internally use the residue of
the given seed modulo `2**31 - 1` (see
`tensorflow/python/framework/random_seed.py`).

#### Returns:

* <b>`seed`</b>: A fresh integer usable as a seed in downstream operations,
    or `None`.
