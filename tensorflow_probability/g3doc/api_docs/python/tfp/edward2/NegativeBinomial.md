# tfp.edward2.NegativeBinomial

``` python
tfp.edward2.NegativeBinomial(
    *args,
    **kwargs
)
```

Create a random variable for NegativeBinomial.

See NegativeBinomial for more details.

#### Returns:

  RandomVariable.

#### Original Docstring for Distribution

Construct NegativeBinomial distributions.


#### Args:

* <b>`total_count`</b>: Non-negative floating-point `Tensor` with shape
    broadcastable to `[B1,..., Bb]` with `b >= 0` and the same dtype as
    `probs` or `logits`. Defines this as a batch of `N1 x ... x Nm`
    different Negative Binomial distributions. In practice, this represents
    the number of negative Bernoulli trials to stop at (the `total_count`
    of failures), but this is still a valid distribution when
    `total_count` is a non-integer.
* <b>`logits`</b>: Floating-point `Tensor` with shape broadcastable to
    `[B1, ..., Bb]` where `b >= 0` indicates the number of batch dimensions.
    Each entry represents logits for the probability of success for
    independent Negative Binomial distributions and must be in the open
    interval `(-inf, inf)`. Only one of `logits` or `probs` should be
    specified.
* <b>`probs`</b>: Positive floating-point `Tensor` with shape broadcastable to
    `[B1, ..., Bb]` where `b >= 0` indicates the number of batch dimensions.
    Each entry represents the probability of success for independent
    Negative Binomial distributions and must be in the open interval
    `(0, 1)`. Only one of `logits` or `probs` should be specified.
* <b>`validate_args`</b>: Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution
    parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime
    performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect
    outputs.
* <b>`allow_nan_stats`</b>: Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`, statistics
    (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to indicate the
    result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised if one or
    more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.
* <b>`name`</b>: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.
