# tfp.edward2.Mixture

``` python
tfp.edward2.Mixture(
    *args,
    **kwargs
)
```

Create a random variable for Mixture.

See Mixture for more details.

#### Returns:

  RandomVariable.

#### Original Docstring for Distribution

Initialize a Mixture distribution.

A `Mixture` is defined by a `Categorical` (`cat`, representing the
mixture probabilities) and a list of `Distribution` objects
all having matching dtype, batch shape, event shape, and continuity
properties (the components).

The `num_classes` of `cat` must be possible to infer at graph construction
time and match `len(components)`.


#### Args:

* <b>`cat`</b>: A `Categorical` distribution instance, representing the probabilities
      of `distributions`.
* <b>`components`</b>: A list or tuple of `Distribution` instances.
    Each instance must have the same type, be defined on the same domain,
    and have matching `event_shape` and `batch_shape`.
* <b>`validate_args`</b>: Python `bool`, default `False`. If `True`, raise a runtime
    error if batch or event ranks are inconsistent between cat and any of
    the distributions. This is only checked if the ranks cannot be
    determined statically at graph construction time.
* <b>`allow_nan_stats`</b>: Boolean, default `True`. If `False`, raise an
   exception if a statistic (e.g. mean/mode/etc...) is undefined for any
    batch member. If `True`, batch members with valid parameters leading to
    undefined statistics will return NaN for this statistic.
* <b>`use_static_graph`</b>: Calls to `sample` will not rely on dynamic tensor
    indexing, allowing for some static graph compilation optimizations, but
    at the expense of sampling all underlying distributions in the mixture.
    (Possibly useful when running on TPUs).
    Default value: `False` (i.e., use dynamic indexing).
* <b>`name`</b>: A name for this distribution (optional).


#### Raises:

* <b>`TypeError`</b>: If cat is not a `Categorical`, or `components` is not
    a list or tuple, or the elements of `components` are not
    instances of `Distribution`, or do not have matching `dtype`.
* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `components` is an empty list or tuple, or its
    elements do not have a statically known event rank.
    If `cat.num_classes` cannot be inferred at graph creation time,
    or the constant value of `cat.num_classes` is not equal to
    `len(components)`, or all `components` and `cat` do not have
    matching static batch shapes, or all components do not
    have matching static event shapes.
