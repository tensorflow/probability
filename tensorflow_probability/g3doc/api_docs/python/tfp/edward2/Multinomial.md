# tfp.edward2.Multinomial

``` python
tfp.edward2.Multinomial(
    *args,
    **kwargs
)
```

Create a random variable for Multinomial.

See Multinomial for more details.

#### Returns:

  RandomVariable.

#### Original Docstring for Distribution

Initialize a batch of Multinomial distributions.


#### Args:

* <b>`total_count`</b>: Non-negative floating point tensor with shape broadcastable
    to `[N1,..., Nm]` with `m >= 0`. Defines this as a batch of
    `N1 x ... x Nm` different Multinomial distributions. Its components
    should be equal to integer values.
* <b>`logits`</b>: Floating point tensor representing unnormalized log-probabilities
    of a positive event with shape broadcastable to
    `[N1,..., Nm, K]` `m >= 0`, and the same dtype as `total_count`. Defines
    this as a batch of `N1 x ... x Nm` different `K` class Multinomial
    distributions. Only one of `logits` or `probs` should be passed in.
* <b>`probs`</b>: Positive floating point tensor with shape broadcastable to
    `[N1,..., Nm, K]` `m >= 0` and same dtype as `total_count`. Defines
    this as a batch of `N1 x ... x Nm` different `K` class Multinomial
    distributions. `probs`'s components in the last portion of its shape
    should sum to `1`. Only one of `logits` or `probs` should be passed in.
* <b>`validate_args`</b>: Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution
    parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime
    performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect
    outputs.
* <b>`allow_nan_stats`</b>: Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`, statistics
    (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to indicate the
    result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised if one or
    more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.
* <b>`name`</b>: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.
