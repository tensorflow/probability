# tfp.edward2.Wishart

``` python
tfp.edward2.Wishart(
    *args,
    **kwargs
)
```

Create a random variable for Wishart.

See Wishart for more details.

#### Returns:

  RandomVariable.

#### Original Docstring for Distribution

Construct Wishart distributions.


#### Args:

* <b>`df`</b>: `float` or `double` `Tensor`. Degrees of freedom, must be greater than
    or equal to dimension of the scale matrix.
* <b>`scale`</b>: `float` or `double` `Tensor`. The symmetric positive definite
    scale matrix of the distribution. Exactly one of `scale` and
    'scale_tril` must be passed.
* <b>`scale_tril`</b>: `float` or `double` `Tensor`. The Cholesky factorization
    of the symmetric positive definite scale matrix of the distribution.
    Exactly one of `scale` and 'scale_tril` must be passed.
* <b>`input_output_cholesky`</b>: Python `bool`. If `True`, functions whose input or
    output have the semantics of samples assume inputs are in Cholesky form
    and return outputs in Cholesky form. In particular, if this flag is
    `True`, input to `log_prob` is presumed of Cholesky form and output from
    `sample`, `mean`, and `mode` are of Cholesky form.  Setting this
    argument to `True` is purely a computational optimization and does not
    change the underlying distribution; for instance, `mean` returns the
    Cholesky of the mean, not the mean of Cholesky factors. The `variance`
    and `stddev` methods are unaffected by this flag.
    Default value: `False` (i.e., input/output does not have Cholesky
    semantics).
* <b>`validate_args`</b>: Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution
    parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime
    performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect
    outputs.
* <b>`allow_nan_stats`</b>: Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`, statistics
    (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to indicate the
    result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised if one or
    more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.
* <b>`name`</b>: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.

#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if zero or both of 'scale' and 'scale_tril' are passed in.
