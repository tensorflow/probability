      description: >
        TensorFlow Probability (TFP) is a Python library built on TensorFlow
        that makes it easy to combine probabilistic models and deep learning on
        modern hardware (TPU, GPU). It's for data scientists, statisticians, ML
        researchers, and practitioners who want to encode domain knowledge to
        understand data and make predictions. TFP includes:
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">
          <li>A wide selection of probability distributions and bijectors.</li>
          <li>Tools to build deep probabilistic models, including probabilistic
          layers and the Edward2 language.</li>
          <li>Variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo.</li>
          <li>Optimizers such as Nelder-Mead, BFGS, and SGLD.</li>
        </ul>
        Since TFP inherits the benefits of TensorFlow, you can build, fit, and
        deploy a model using a single language throughout the lifecycle of model
        exploration and production. To get started, see the
        <a href="./overview">TensorFlow Probability Guide</a>.
