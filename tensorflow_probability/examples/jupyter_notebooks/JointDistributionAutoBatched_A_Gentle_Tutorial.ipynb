        "TensorFlow Probability (TFP) offers a number of `JointDistribution` abstractions that make probabilistic inference easier by allowing a user to easily express a probabilistic graphical model in a near-mathematical form; the abstraction generates methods for sampling from the model and evaluating the log probability of samples from the model. In this tutorial, we review \"autobatched\" variants, which were developed after the original `JointDistribution` abstractions. Relative to the original, non-autobatched abstractions, the autobatched versions are simpler to use and more ergonomic, allowing many models to be expressed with less boilerplate. In this colab, we explore a simple model in (perhaps tedious) detail, making clear the problems autobatching solves, and (hopefully) teaching the reader more about TFP shape concepts along the way.\n",

        "Prior to the introduction of autobatching, there were a few different variants of `JointDistribution`, corresponding to different syntactic styles for expressing probabilistic models: `JointDistributionSequential`, `JointDistributionNamed`, and`JointDistributionCoroutine`. Auobatching exists as a mixin, so we now have `AutoBatched` variants of all of these. In this tutorial, we explore the differences between `JointDistributionSequential` and `JointDistributionSequentialAutoBatched`; however, everything we do here is applicable to the other variants with essentially no changes.\n"

The latter sums over a 7-Tensor, each element of which is the sum of the log probability of `m`, `b`, and a single element of the log probability of `Y`, so it overcounts `m` and `b`. (`log_prob(m) + log_prob(b) + log_prob(Y)` returns a result rather than throwing an exception because TFP follows TF and NumPy's broadcasting rules; adding a scalar to a vector produces a vector-sized result.)\n",
        "- In this particular case, we could have solved the problem and achieved the same result using `MultivariateNormalDiag` instead of `Independent(Normal(...))`. `MultivariateNormalDiag` is a vector-valued distribution (i.e., it already has vector event-shape). Indeeed `MultivariateNormalDiag` could be (but isn't) implemented as a composition of `Independent` and `Normal`. It's worthwhile to remember that given a vector `V`, samples from `n1 = Normal(loc=V)`, and `n2 = MultivariateNormalDiag(loc=V)` are indistinguishable; the difference beween these distributions is that `n1.log_prob(n1.sample())` is a vector and `n2.log_prob(n2.sample())` is a scalar."

While you could attempt to [read the code](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/master/tensorflow_probability/python/distributions/joint_distribution_auto_batched.py#L426) for a deep understanding, we'll give a brief overview which is sufficient for most use cases:\n",
        "- Recall that our first problem was that our distribution for `Y` had `batch_shape=[7]` and `event_shape=[]`, and we used `Independent` to convert the batch dimension to an event dimension. JDSAB ignores the batch shapes of component distributions; instead it treats batch shape as an overall property of the model, which is assumed to be `[]` (unless specified otherwise by setting `batch_ndims \u003e 0`). The effect is equivalent to using tfd.Independent to convert *all* batch dimensions of component distributions into event dimensions, as we did manually above.\n",
        "- Our second problem was a need to massage the shapes of `m` and `b` so that they could broadcast appropriately with `X` when creating multiple samples. With JDSAB, you write a model to generate a single sample, and we \"lift\" the entire model to generate multiple samples using TensorFlow's [vectorized_map](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/vectorized_map).
