  """Fit a surrogate posterior to a target (unnormalized) log density.

  The default behavior constructs and minimizes the negative variational
  evidence lower bound (ELBO), given by

  ```python
  q_samples = surrogate_posterior.sample(num_draws)
  elbo_loss = -tf.reduce_mean(
    target_log_prob_fn(q_samples) - surrogate_posterior.log_prob(q_samples))
  ```

  This corresponds to minimizing the 'reverse' Kullback-Liebler divergence
  (`KL[q||p]`) between the variational distribution and the unnormalized
  `target_log_prob_fn`, and  defines a lower bound on the marginal log
  likelihood, `log p(x) >= -elbo_loss`. [1]

  More generally, this function supports fitting variational distributions that
  minimize any
  [Csiszar f-divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-divergence).

  Args:
    target_log_prob_fn: Python callable that takes a set of `Tensor` arguments
      and returns a `Tensor` log-density. Given
      `q_sample = surrogate_posterior.sample(sample_size)`, this
      will be called as `target_log_prob_fn(*q_sample)` if `q_sample` is a list
      or a tuple, `target_log_prob_fn(**q_sample)` if `q_sample` is a
      dictionary, or `target_log_prob_fn(q_sample)` if `q_sample` is a `Tensor`.
      It should support batched evaluation, i.e., should return a result of
      shape `[sample_size]`.
    surrogate_posterior: A `tfp.distributions.Distribution`
      instance defining a variational posterior (could be a
      `tfd.JointDistribution`). Crucially, the distribution's `log_prob` and
      (if reparameterized) `sample` methods must directly invoke all ops
      that generate gradients to the underlying variables. One way to ensure
      this is to use `tfp.util.TransformedVariable` and/or
      `tfp.util.DeferredTensor` to represent any parameters defined as
      transformations of unconstrained variables, so that the transformations
      execute at runtime instead of at distribution creation.
    optimizer: Optimizer instance to use. This may be a TF1-style
      `tf.train.Optimizer`, TF2-style `tf.optimizers.Optimizer`, or any Python
      object that implements `optimizer.apply_gradients(grads_and_vars)`.
    num_steps: Python `int` number of steps to run the optimizer.
    trace_fn: Python callable with signature `state = trace_fn(
      loss, grads, variables)`, where `state` may be a `Tensor` or nested
      structure of `Tensor`s. The state values are accumulated (by `tf.scan`)
      and returned. The default `trace_fn` simply returns the loss, but in
      general can depend on the gradients and variables (if
      `trainable_variables` is not `None` then `variables==trainable_variables`;
      otherwise it is the list of all variables accessed during execution of
      `loss_fn()`), as well as any other quantities captured in the closure of
      `trace_fn`, for example, statistics of a variational distribution.
      Default value: `lambda loss, grads, variables: loss`.
    variational_loss_fn: Python `callable` with signature
      `loss = variational_loss_fn(target_log_prob_fn, surrogate_posterior,
       sample_size, seed)` defining a variational loss function. The default is
       a Monte Carlo approximation to the standard evidence lower bound (ELBO),
       equivalent to minimizing the 'reverse' `KL[q||p]` divergence between the
       surrogate `q` and true posterior `p`. [1]
       Default value: `functools.partial(
         tfp.vi.monte_carlo_variational_loss,
         discrepancy_fn=tfp.vi.kl_reverse,
         use_reparameterization=True)`.
    sample_size: Python `int` number of Monte Carlo samples to use
      in estimating the variational divergence. Larger values may stabilize
      the optimization, but at higher cost per step in time and memory.
      Default value: `1`.
    trainable_variables: Optional list of `tf.Variable` instances to optimize
      with respect to. If `None`, defaults to the set of all variables accessed
      during the computation of the variational bound, i.e., those defining
      `surrogate_posterior` and the model `target_log_prob_fn`.
      Default value: `None`
    seed: Python integer to seed the random number generator.
    name: Python `str` name prefixed to ops created by this function.
      Default value: 'fit_surrogate_posterior'.

  Returns:
    results: `Tensor` or nested structure of `Tensor`s, according to the
      return type of `result_fn`. Each `Tensor` has an added leading dimension
      of size `num_steps`, packing the trajectory of the result over the course
      of the optimization.

  #### Examples

  **Normal-Normal model**. We'll first consider a simple model
  `z ~ N(0, 1)`, `x ~ N(z, 1)`, where we suppose we are interested in the
  posterior `p(z | x=5)`:

  ```python
  import tensorflow_probability as tfp
  from tensorflow_probability import distributions as tfd

  def log_prob(z, x):
    return tfd.Normal(0., 1.).log_prob(z) + tfd.Normal(z, 1.).log_prob(x)
  conditioned_log_prob = lambda z: log_prob(z, x=5.)
  ```

  The posterior is itself normal by [conjugacy](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior), and can be computed
  analytically (it's `N(loc=5/2., scale=1/sqrt(2)`). But suppose we don't want
  to bother doing the math: we can use variational inference instead!

  ```python
  q_z = tfd.Normal(loc=tf.Variable(0., name='q_z_loc'),
                   scale=tfp.util.TransformedVariable(1., tfb.Softplus(),
                                                      name='q_z_scale'),
                   name='q_z')
  losses = tfp.vi.fit_surrogate_posterior(
      conditioned_log_prob,
      surrogate_posterior=q,
      optimizer=tf.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1),
      num_steps=100)
  print(q_z.mean(), q_z.stddev())  # => approximately [2.5, 1/sqrt(2)]
  ```

  Note that we ensure positive scale by using a softplus transformation of
  the underlying variable, invoked via `TransformedVariable`. Deferring the
  transformation causes it to be applied upon evaluation of the distribution's
  methods, creating a gradient to the underlying variable. If we
  had simply specified `scale=tf.nn.softplus(scale_var)` directly,
  without the `TransformedVariable`, fitting would fail because calls to
  `q.log_prob` and `q.sample` would never access the underlying variable. In
  general, transformations of trainable parameters must be deferred to runtime,
  using either `TransformedVariable` or `DeferredTensor` or by the callable
  mechanisms available in joint distribution classes (demonstrated below).

  **Custom loss function**. Suppose we prefer to fit the same model using
    the forward KL divergence `KL[p||q]`. We can pass a custom loss function:

  ```python
    import functools
    forward_kl_loss = functools.partial(
      tfp.vi.monte_carlo_variational_loss, discrepancy_fn=tfp.vi.kl_forward)
    losses = tfp.vi.fit_surrogate_posterior(
        conditioned_log_prob,
        surrogate_posterior=q,
        optimizer=tf.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1),
        num_steps=100,
        variational_loss_fn=forward_kl_loss)
  ```

  Note that in practice this may have substantially higher-variance gradients
  than the reverse KL.

  **Inhomogeneous Poisson Process**. For a more interesting example, let's
  consider a model with multiple latent variables as well as trainable
  parameters in the model itself. Given observed counts `y` from spatial
  locations `X`, consider an inhomogeneous Poisson process model
  `log_rates = GaussianProcess(index_points=X); y = Poisson(exp(log_rates))`
  in which the latent (log) rates are spatially correlated following a Gaussian
  process. We'll fit a variational model to the latent rates while also
  optimizing the GP kernel hyperparameters (largely for illustration; in
  practice we might prefer to 'be Bayesian' about these parameters and include
  them as latents in our model and variational posterior). First we define
  the model, including trainable variables:

  ```python
  # Toy 1D data.
  index_points = np.array([-10., -7.2, -4., -0.1, 0.1, 4., 6.2, 9.]).reshape(
      [-1, 1]).astype(np.float32)
  observed_counts = np.array(
      [100, 90, 60, 13, 18, 37, 55, 42]).astype(np.float32)

  # Trainable GP hyperparameters.
  kernel_log_amplitude = tf.Variable(0., name='kernel_log_amplitude')
  kernel_log_lengthscale = tf.Variable(0., name='kernel_log_lengthscale')
  observation_noise_log_scale = tf.Variable(
    0., name='observation_noise_log_scale')

  # Generative model.
  Root = tfd.JointDistributionCoroutine.Root
  def model_fn():
    kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.ExponentiatedQuadratic(
        amplitude=tf.exp(kernel_log_amplitude),
        length_scale=tf.exp(kernel_log_lengthscale))
    latent_log_rates = yield Root(tfd.GaussianProcess(
        kernel,
        index_points=index_points,
        observation_noise_variance=tf.exp(observation_noise_log_scale),
        name='latent_log_rates'))
    y = yield tfd.Independent(tfd.Poisson(log_rate=latent_log_rates, name='y'),
                              reinterpreted_batch_ndims=1)
  model = tfd.JointDistributionCoroutine(model_fn)
  ```

  Next we define a variational distribution. We incorporate the observations
  directly into the variational model using the 'trick' of representing them
  by a deterministic distribution (observe that the true posterior on an
  observed value is in fact a point mass at the observed value).

  ```
  logit_locs = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(observed_counts.shape), name='logit_locs')
  logit_softplus_scales = tf.Variable(tf.ones(observed_counts.shape) * -4,
                                      name='logit_softplus_scales')
  def variational_model_fn():
    latent_rates = yield Root(tfd.Independent(
      tfd.Normal(loc=logit_locs, scale=tf.nn.softplus(logit_softplus_scales)),
      reinterpreted_batch_ndims=1))
    y = yield tfd.VectorDeterministic(y)
  q = tfd.JointDistributionCoroutine(variational_model_fn)
  ```

  Note that here we could apply transforms to variables without using
  `DeferredTensor` because the `JointDistributionCoroutine` argument is a
  function, i.e., executed "on demand." (The same is true when
  distribution-making functions are supplied to `JointDistributionSequential`
  and `JointDistributionNamed`. That is, as long as variables are transformed
  *within* the callable, they will appear on the gradient tape when
  `q.log_prob()` or `q.sample()` are invoked.

  Finally, we fit the variational posterior and model variables jointly: by not
  explicitly specifying `trainable_variables`, the optimization will
  automatically include all variables accessed. We'll
  use a custom `trace_fn` to see how the kernel amplitudes and a set of sampled
  latent rates with fixed seed evolve during the course of the optimization:

  ```python
  losses, log_amplitude_path, sample_path = tfp.vi.fit_surrogate_posterior(
    target_log_prob_fn=lambda *args: model.log_prob(args),
    surrogate_posterior=q,
    optimizer=tf.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1),
    sample_size=1,
    num_steps=500,
    trace_fn=lambda loss, grads, vars: (loss, kernel_log_amplitude,
                                        q.sample(5, seed=42)[0]))
  ```
