  """Takes Edward probabilistic program and returns its log joint function.

  Args:
    model: Python callable which executes the generative process of a
      computable probability distribution using `ed.RandomVariable`s.

  Returns:
    A log-joint probability function. Its inputs are `model`'s original inputs
    and random variables which appear during the program execution. Its output
    is a scalar tf.Tensor.

  #### Examples

  Below we define Bayesian logistic regression as an Edward program,
  representing the model's generative process. We apply `make_log_joint_fn` in
  order to represent the model in terms of its joint probability function.

  ```python
  from tensorflow_probability import edward2 as ed

  def logistic_regression(features):
    coeffs = ed.Normal(loc=0., scale=1.,
                       sample_shape=features.shape[1], name="coeffs")
    outcomes = ed.Bernoulli(logits=tf.tensordot(features, coeffs, [[1], [0]]),
                            name="outcomes")
    return outcomes

  log_joint = ed.make_log_joint_fn(logistic_regression)

  features = tf.random_normal([3, 2])
  coeffs_value = tf.random_normal([2])
  outcomes_value = tf.round(tf.random_uniform([3]))
  output = log_joint(features, coeffs=coeffs_value, outcomes=outcomes_value)
  ```
