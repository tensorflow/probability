  """Runs one step of the slice sampler using a hit and run approach.

  Slice Sampling is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm based, as stated
  by [Neal (2003)][1], on the observation that "...one can sample from a
  distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its
  density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution
  can be constructed by alternately uniform sampling in the vertical direction
  with uniform sampling from the horizontal `slice` defined by the current
  vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform
  distribution over this slice invariant". Mathematical details and derivations
  can be found in [Neal (2003)][1]. The one dimensional slice sampler is
  extended to n-dimensions through use of a hit-and-run approach: choose a
  random direction in n-dimensional space and take a step, as determined by the
  one-dimensional slice sampling algorithm, along that direction
  [Belisle at al. 1993][2].

  The `one_step` function can update multiple chains in parallel. It assumes
  that all leftmost dimensions of `current_state` index independent chain states
  (and are therefore updated independently). The output of
  `target_log_prob_fn(*current_state)` should sum log-probabilities across all
  event dimensions. Slices along the rightmost dimensions may have different
  target distributions; for example, `current_state[0, :]` could have a
  different target distribution from `current_state[1, :]`. These semantics are
  governed by `target_log_prob_fn(*current_state)`. (The number of independent
  chains is `tf.size(target_log_prob_fn(*current_state))`.)

  Note that the sampler only supports states where all components have a common
  dtype.

  ### Examples:

  #### Simple chain with warm-up.

  In this example we sample from a standard univariate normal
  distribution using slice sampling.

  ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    import tensorflow_probability as tfp
    import numpy as np

    tfd = tfp.distributions

    dtype = np.float32

    target = tfd.Normal(loc=dtype(0), scale=dtype(1))

    samples, _ = tfp.mcmc.sample_chain(
        num_results=1000,
        current_state=dtype(1),
        kernel=tfp.mcmc.SliceSampler(
            target.log_prob,
            step_size=1.0,
            max_doublings=5,
            seed=1234),
        num_burnin_steps=500,
        parallel_iterations=1)  # For determinism.

    sample_mean = tf.reduce_mean(samples, axis=0)
    sample_std = tf.sqrt(
      tf.reduce_mean(tf.squared_difference(samples, sample_mean),
                     axis=0))

    with tf.Session() as sess:
      [sample_mean, sample_std] = sess.run([sample_mean, sample_std])

    print "Sample mean: ", sample_mean
    print "Sample Std: ", sample_std
  ```

  #### Sample from a Two Dimensional Normal.

  In the following example we sample from a two dimensional Normal
  distribution using slice sampling.

  ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    import tensorflow_probability as tfp
    import numpy as np

    tfd = tfp.distributions

    dtype = np.float32
    true_mean = dtype([0, 0])
    true_cov = dtype([[1, 0.5], [0.5, 1]])
    num_results = 500
    num_chains = 50

    # Target distribution is defined through the Cholesky decomposition
    chol = tf.linalg.cholesky(true_cov)
    target = tfd.MultivariateNormalTriL(loc=true_mean, scale_tril=chol)

    # Assume that the state is passed as a list of 1-d tensors `x` and `y`.
    # Then the target log-density is defined as follows:
    def target_log_prob(x, y):
      # Stack the input tensors together
      z = tf.stack([x, y], axis=-1) - true_mean
      return target.log_prob(z)

    # Initial state of the chain
    init_state = [np.ones([num_chains, 1], dtype=dtype),
                  np.ones([num_chains, 1], dtype=dtype)]

    # Run Slice Samper for `num_results` iterations for `num_chains`
    # independent chains:
    [x, y], _ = tfp.mcmc.sample_chain(
        num_results=num_results,
        current_state=init_state,
        kernel=tfp.mcmc.SliceSampler(
            target_log_prob_fn=target_log_prob,
            step_size=1.0,
            max_doublings=5,
            seed=47),
        num_burnin_steps=200,
        num_steps_between_results=1,
        parallel_iterations=1)

    states = tf.stack([x, y], axis=-1)
    sample_mean = tf.reduce_mean(states, axis=[0, 1])
    z = states - sample_mean
    sample_cov = tf.reduce_mean(tf.matmul(z, z, transpose_a=True),
                                axis=[0, 1])

    with tf.Session() as sess:
      [sample_mean, sample_cov] = sess.run([
          sample_mean, sample_cov])

    print "sample_mean: ", sample_mean
    print "sample_cov: ", sample_cov
  ```
