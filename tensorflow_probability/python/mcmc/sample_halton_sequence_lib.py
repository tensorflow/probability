  r"""Returns a sample from the `dim` dimensional Halton sequence.

  Warning: The sequence elements take values only between 0 and 1. Care must be
  taken to appropriately transform the domain of a function if it differs from
  the unit cube before evaluating integrals using Halton samples. It is also
  important to remember that quasi-random numbers without randomization are not
  a replacement for pseudo-random numbers in every context. Quasi random numbers
  are completely deterministic and typically have significant negative
  autocorrelation unless randomization is used.

  Computes the members of the low discrepancy Halton sequence in dimension
  `dim`. The `dim`-dimensional sequence takes values in the unit hypercube in
  `dim` dimensions. Currently, only dimensions up to 10000 are supported. The
  prime base for the k-th axes is the k-th prime starting from 2. For example,
  if `dim` = 3, then the bases will be [2, 3, 5] respectively and the first
  element of the non-randomized sequence will be: [0.5, 0.333, 0.2]. For a more
  complete description of the Halton sequences see
  [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halton_sequence). For low discrepancy
  sequences and their applications see
  [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-discrepancy_sequence).

  If `randomized` is true, this function produces a scrambled version of the
  Halton sequence introduced by [Owen (2017)][1]. For the advantages of
  randomization of low discrepancy sequences see [here](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-Monte_Carlo_method#Randomization_of_quasi-Monte_Carlo).

  The number of samples produced is controlled by the `num_results` and
  `sequence_indices` parameters. The user must supply either `num_results` or
  `sequence_indices` but not both.
  The former is the number of samples to produce starting from the first
  element. If `sequence_indices` is given instead, the specified elements of
  the sequence are generated. For example, sequence_indices=tf.range(10) is
  equivalent to specifying n=10.

  #### Examples

  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  import tensorflow_probability as tfp

  # Produce the first 1000 members of the Halton sequence in 3 dimensions.
  num_results = 1000
  dim = 3
  sample = tfp.mcmc.sample_halton_sequence(
    dim,
    num_results=num_results,
    seed=127)

  # Evaluate the integral of x_1 * x_2^2 * x_3^3  over the three dimensional
  # hypercube.
  powers = tf.range(1.0, limit=dim + 1)
  integral = tf.reduce_mean(tf.reduce_prod(sample ** powers, axis=-1))
  true_value = 1.0 / tf.reduce_prod(powers + 1.0)
  with tf.Session() as session:
    values = session.run((integral, true_value))

  # Produces a relative absolute error of 1.7%.
  print ("Estimated: %f, True Value: %f" % values)

  # Now skip the first 1000 samples and recompute the integral with the next
  # thousand samples. The sequence_indices argument can be used to do this.


  sequence_indices = tf.range(start=1000, limit=1000 + num_results,
                              dtype=tf.int32)
  sample_leaped = tfp.mcmc.sample_halton_sequence(
      dim,
      sequence_indices=sequence_indices,
      seed=111217)

  integral_leaped = tf.reduce_mean(tf.reduce_prod(sample_leaped ** powers,
                                                  axis=-1))
  with tf.Session() as session:
    values = session.run((integral_leaped, true_value))
  # Now produces a relative absolute error of 0.05%.
  print ("Leaped Estimated: %f, True Value: %f" % values)
  ```

  Args:
    dim: Positive Python `int` representing each sample's `event_size.` Must
      not be greater than 10000.
    num_results: (Optional) Positive scalar `Tensor` of dtype int32. The number
      of samples to generate. Either this parameter or sequence_indices must
      be specified but not both. If this parameter is None, then the behaviour
      is determined by the `sequence_indices`.
      Default value: `None`.
    sequence_indices: (Optional) `Tensor` of dtype int32 and rank 1. The
      elements of the sequence to compute specified by their position in the
      sequence. The entries index into the Halton sequence starting with 0 and
      hence, must be whole numbers. For example, sequence_indices=[0, 5, 6] will
      produce the first, sixth and seventh elements of the sequence. If this
      parameter is None, then the `num_results` parameter must be specified
      which gives the number of desired samples starting from the first sample.
      Default value: `None`.
    dtype: (Optional) The dtype of the sample. One of: `float16`, `float32` or
      `float64`.
      Default value: `tf.float32`.
    randomized: (Optional) bool indicating whether to produce a randomized
      Halton sequence. If True, applies the randomization described in
      [Owen (2017)][1].
      Default value: `True`.
    seed: PRNG seed; see `tfp.random.sanitize_seed` for details. Only used if
      `randomized` is True. If not supplied and `randomized` is True, no seed is
      set.
      Default value: `None`.
    name:  (Optional) Python `str` describing ops managed by this function. If
      not supplied the name of this function is used.
      Default value: "sample_halton_sequence".

  Returns:
    halton_elements: Elements of the Halton sequence. `Tensor` of supplied dtype
      and `shape` `[num_results, dim]` if `num_results` was specified or shape
      `[s, dim]` where s is the size of `sequence_indices` if `sequence_indices`
      were specified.

  Raises:
    ValueError: if both `sequence_indices` and `num_results` were specified or
      if dimension `dim` is less than 1 or greater than 10000.
