  """Takes `num_steps` repeated `TransitionKernel` steps from `current_state`.

  This is meant to be a minimal driver for executing `TransitionKernel`s; for
  something more featureful, see `sample_chain`.

  Args:
    num_steps: Integer number of Markov chain steps.
    current_state: `Tensor` or Python `list` of `Tensor`s representing the
      current state(s) of the Markov chain(s).
    previous_kernel_results: A `Tensor` or a nested collection of `Tensor`s.
      Warm-start for the auxiliary state needed by the given `kernel`.
      If not supplied, `step_kernel` will cold-start with
      `kernel.bootstrap_results`.
    kernel: An instance of `tfp.mcmc.TransitionKernel` which implements one step
      of the Markov chain.
    return_final_kernel_results: If `True`, then the final kernel results are
      returned alongside the chain state after `num_steps` steps are taken.
      This can be useful to inspect the final auxiliary state, or for a later
      warm restart.
    parallel_iterations: The number of iterations allowed to run in parallel. It
      must be a positive integer. See `tf.while_loop` for more details.
    seed: PRNG seed; see `tfp.random.sanitize_seed` for details.
    name: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this function.
      Default value: `None` (i.e., 'mcmc_step_kernel').

  Returns:
    next_state: Markov chain state after `num_step` steps are taken, of
      identical type as `current_state`.
    final_kernel_results: kernel results, as supplied by `kernel.one_step` after
      `num_step` steps are taken. This is only returned if
      `return_final_kernel_results` is `True`.
