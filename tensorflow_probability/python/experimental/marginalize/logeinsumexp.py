    a: a tensor compatible with the given indices. For example
      consider the case
        `formula_a == ijik` and `a.shape == [2, 3, 2, 4]`.
      These are compatible because the tensor has rank 4 and
      the string has 4 index letters. Additionally the first and
      third index letters are the same corresponding to the first
      and third dimensions of the tensor shape being equal.

  Returns:
    If there are any repeated indices in the index string then
    these correspond to entries in `a` along a generalized
    diagonal. For example the 'ii' entries in a 3x3 matrix `m`
    correspond to the 3 diagonal entries of `m`.
    `_extract_diagonals('ii', m)` returns a pair consisting of
    a 3-vector representing the diagonal of `m` as well as the
    index string `i` indicating that the extraction was
    equivalent to computing `einsum('ii->i', m)`.
    If we have an einsum formula like 'ijik,j,k->jk'
    then we can reduce it to an einsum of the form
    'ijk,j,k->jk', removing the repeated indices,

  """Perform contractions contained completely within a single tensor.

  Args:
    formula_a: a string of indices compatible with the given tensor.
    a: a tensor compatible with the given indices.
    other: a string of indices.

  Returns:
    If an einsum formula contains indices that correspond solely to
    dimensions of one tensor and appear nowhere among the indices
    for the other input arguments or the output then these describe
    a summation or contraction within that tensor.
    For example an einsum formula like 'ij,kj,lk->...'
    we can completely eliminate all occurrences of 'i' from the
    formula by applying `_internal_contract` to the appropriate tensor.
    `_internal_contract` also updates the appropriate part of the formula
    reflect the eliminations.
    For example if `m` is a 10x3x3 tensor considered as an array
    of 10 3-vectors, `_internal_contract('ji', m)` will return
    a vector consisting of the sums of the 10 vectors along with the
    string 'j' indicating the index 'j' was not reduced or contracted over.
    Note that this function sums in log space so it in fact uses
    `reduce_logsumexp` to compute the sum.
    Note also that this function is written on the assumption that repeated
    indices have already been removed by `_extract_diagonals`.
