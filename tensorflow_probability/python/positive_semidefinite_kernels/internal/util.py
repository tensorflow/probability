    sqrt: the square root of `x`, with an overridden gradient at zero
    grad: a gradient function, which is the same as sqrt's gradient everywhere
      except at zero, where it is given a large finite value, instead of `inf`.

  Raises:
    TypeError: if `tf.convert_to_tensor(x)` is not a `float` type.

  Often in kernel functions, we need to compute the L2 norm of the difference
  between two vectors, `x` and `y`: `sqrt(sum_i((x_i - y_i) ** 2))`. In the
  case where `x` and `y` are identical, e.g., on the diagonal of a kernel
  matrix, we get `NaN`s when we take gradients with respect to the inputs. To
  see, this consider the forward pass:

    ```
    [x_1 ... x_N]  -->  [x_1 ** 2 ... x_N ** 2]  -->
        (x_1 ** 2 + ... + x_N ** 2)  -->  sqrt((x_1 ** 2 + ... + x_N ** 2))
    ```

  When we backprop through this forward pass, the `sqrt` yields an `inf` because
  `grad_z(sqrt(z)) = 1 / (2 * sqrt(z))`. Continuing the backprop to the left, at
  the `x ** 2` term, we pick up a `2 * x`, and when `x` is zero, we get
  `0 * inf`, which is `NaN`.

  We'd like to avoid these `NaN`s, since they infect the rest of the connected
  computation graph. Practically, when two inputs to a kernel function are
  equal, we are in one of two scenarios:
    1. We are actually computing k(x, x), in which case norm(x - x) is
       identically zero, independent of x. In this case, we'd like the
       gradient to reflect this independence: it should be zero.
    2. We are computing k(x, y), and x just *happens* to have the same value
       as y. The gradient at such inputs is in fact ill-defined (there is a
       cusp in the sqrt((x - y) ** 2) surface along the line x = y). There are,
       however, an infinite number of sub-gradients, all of which are valid at
       all such inputs. By symmetry, there is exactly one which is "special":
       zero, and we elect to use that value here. In practice, having two
       identical inputs to a kernel matrix is probably a pathological
       situation to be avoided, but that is better resolved at a higher level
       than this.

  To avoid the infinite gradient at zero, we use tf.custom_gradient to redefine
  the gradient at zero. We assign it to be a very large value, specifically
  the sqrt of the max value of the floating point dtype of the input. We use
  the sqrt (as opposed to just using the max floating point value) to avoid
  potential overflow when combining this value with others downstream.
