  """Computes `log(abs(sum(weight * exp(elements across tensor dimensions))))`.

  If all weights `w` are known to be positive, it is more efficient to directly
  use `reduce_logsumexp`, i.e., `tf.reduce_logsumexp(logx + tf.log(w))` is more
  efficient than `du.reduce_weighted_logsumexp(logx, w)`.

  Reduces `input_tensor` along the dimensions given in `axis`.
  Unless `keep_dims` is true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each
  entry in `axis`. If `keep_dims` is true, the reduced dimensions
  are retained with length 1.

  If `axis` has no entries, all dimensions are reduced, and a
  tensor with a single element is returned.

  This function is more numerically stable than log(sum(w * exp(input))). It
  avoids overflows caused by taking the exp of large inputs and underflows
  caused by taking the log of small inputs.

  For example:

  ```python
  x = tf.constant([[0., 0, 0],
                   [0, 0, 0]])

  w = tf.constant([[-1., 1, 1],

  # ==> [[log(-1+1+1)], [log(1+1+1)]]

  du.reduce_weighted_logsumexp(x, w, axis=[0, 1])
  # ==> log(-1+5)

  Args:
    logx: The tensor to reduce. Should have numeric type.
    w: The weight tensor. Should have numeric type identical to `logx`.
    axis: The dimensions to reduce. If `None` (the default), reduces all

def soft_threshold(x, threshold, name=None):
  """Soft Thresholding operator.

  This operator is defined by the equations

  ```none
                                { x[i] - gamma,  x[i] >   gamma
  SoftThreshold(x, gamma)[i] =  { 0,             x[i] ==  gamma
                                { x[i] + gamma,  x[i] <  -gamma
  ```

  In the context of proximal gradient methods, we have

  ```none
  SoftThreshold(x, gamma) = prox_{gamma L1}(x)
  ```

  where `prox` is the proximity operator.  Thus the soft thresholding operator
  is used in proximal gradient descent for optimizing a smooth function with
  (non-smooth) L1 regularization, as outlined below.

  The proximity operator is defined as:

  ```none
  prox_r(x) = argmin{ r(z) + 0.5 ||x - z||_2**2 : z },
  ```

  where `r` is a (weakly) convex function, not necessarily differentiable.
  Because the L2 norm is strictly convex, the above argmin is unique.

  One important application of the proximity operator is as follows.  Let `L` be
  a convex and differentiable function with Lipschitz-continuous gradient.  Let
  `R` be a convex lower semicontinuous function which is possibly
  nondifferentiable.  Let `gamma` be an arbitrary positive real.  Then

  ```none
  x_star = argmin{ L(x) + R(x) : x }
  ```

  if and only if the fixed-point equation is satisfied:

  ```none
  x_star = prox_{gamma R}(x_star - gamma grad L(x_star))
  ```

  Proximal gradient descent thus typically consists of choosing an initial value
  `x^{(0)}` and repeatedly applying the update

  ```none
  x^{(k+1)} = prox_{gamma^{(k)} R}(x^{(k)} - gamma^{(k)} grad L(x^{(k)}))
  ```

  where `gamma` is allowed to vary from iteration to iteration.  Specializing to
  the case where `R(x) = ||x||_1`, we minimize `L(x) + ||x||_1` by repeatedly
  applying the update

  ```
  x^{(k+1)} = SoftThreshold(x - gamma grad L(x^{(k)}), gamma)
  ```

  (This idea can also be extended to second-order approximations, although the
  multivariate case does not have a known closed form like above.)

  Args:
    x: `float` `Tensor` representing the input to the SoftThreshold function.
    threshold: nonnegative scalar, `float` `Tensor` representing the radius of
      the interval on which each coordinate of SoftThreshold takes the value
      zero.  Denoted `gamma` above.
    name: Python string indicating the name of the TensorFlow operation.
      Default value: `'soft_threshold'`.

  Returns:
    softthreshold: `float` `Tensor` with the same shape and dtype as `x`,
      representing the value of the SoftThreshold function.
