def value_and_gradient(f, xs, use_gradient_tape=False, name=None):
  """Computes `f(*xs)` and its gradients wrt to `*xs`.

  Args:
    f: Python `callable` to be differentiated. If `f` returns a scalar, this
      scalar will be differentiated. If `f` returns a tensor or list of tensors,
      by default a scalar will be computed by adding all their values to produce
      a single scalar. If desired, the tensors can be elementwise multiplied by
      the tensors passed as the `dy` keyword argument to the returned gradient
      function.
    xs: Python list of parameters of f for which to differentiate. (Can also
      be single `Tensor`.)
    use_gradient_tape: Python `bool` indicating that `tf.GradientTape`
      should be used regardles of `tf.executing_eagerly()` status.
      Default value: `False`.
    name: Python `str` name prefixed to ops created by this function.
      Default value: `None` (i.e., `'value_and_gradient'`).

  Returns:
    y: `y = f(*xs)`.
    dydx: Gradient of `y` wrt each of `xs`.
