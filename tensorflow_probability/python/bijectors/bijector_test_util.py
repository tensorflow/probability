  """Assert `bijector`'s forward/inverse/inverse_log_det_jacobian are congruent.

  We draw samples `X ~ U(lower_x, upper_x)`, then feed these through the
  `bijector` in order to check that:

  1. the forward is strictly monotonic.
  2. the forward/inverse methods are inverses of each other.
  3. the jacobian is the correct change of measure.

  This can only be used for a Bijector mapping open subsets of the real line
  to themselves.  This is due to the fact that this test compares the `prob`
  before/after transformation with the Lebesgue measure on the line.

  Args:
    bijector:  Instance of Bijector
    lower_x:  Python scalar.
    upper_x:  Python scalar.  Must have `lower_x < upper_x`, and both must be in
      the domain of the `bijector`.  The `bijector` should probably not produce
      huge variation in values in the interval `(lower_x, upper_x)`, or else the
      variance based check of the Jacobian will require small `rtol` or huge
      `n`.
    eval_func: Function to evaluate any intermediate results.
    n:  Number of samples to draw for the checks.
    rtol:  Positive number.  Used for the Jacobian check.
