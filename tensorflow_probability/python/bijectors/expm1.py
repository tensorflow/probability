class Expm1(bijector.Bijector):
  """Compute `Y = g(X) = exp(X) - 1`.

    This `Bijector` is no different from Chain([AffineScalar(shift=-1), Exp()]).

    However, this makes use of the more numerically stable routines
    `tf.math.expm1` and `tf.log1p`.

    Example Use:

    ```python
    # Create the Y=g(X)=expm1(X) transform.
    expm1 = Expm1()
    x = [[[1., 2],
           [3, 4]],
          [[5, 6],
           [7, 8]]]
    expm1(x) == expm1.forward(x)
    log1p(x) == expm1.inverse(x)
    ```

    Note: the expm1(.) is applied element-wise but the Jacobian is a reduction
    over the event space.
