class SinhArcsinh(bijector.Bijector):
  """Compute `Y = g(X) = Sinh( (Arcsinh(X) + skewness) * tailweight )`.

  For `skewness in (-inf, inf)` and `tailweight in (0, inf)`, this
  transformation is a
  diffeomorphism of the real line `(-inf, inf)`.  The inverse transform is
  `X = g^{-1}(Y) = Sinh( ArcSinh(Y) / tailweight - skewness )`.

  The `SinhArcsinh` transformation of the Normal is described in
  [Sinh-arcsinh distributions](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27798865)
  This Bijector allows a similar transformation of any distribution supported on
  `(-inf, inf)`.

  #### Meaning of the parameters

  * If `skewness = 0` and `tailweight = 1`, this transform is the identity.
  * Positive (negative) `skewness` leads to positive (negative) skew.
    * positive skew means, for unimodal `X` centered at zero, the mode of `Y` is
      "tilted" to the right.
    * positive skew means positive values of `Y` become more likely, and
      negative values become less likely.
  * Larger (smaller) `tailweight` leads to fatter (thinner) tails.
    * Fatter tails mean larger values of `|Y|` become more likely.
    * If `X` is a unit Normal, `tailweight < 1` leads to a distribution that is
      "flat" around `Y = 0`, and a very steep drop-off in the tails.
    * If `X` is a unit Normal, `tailweight > 1` leads to a distribution more
      peaked at the mode with heavier tails.

  To see the argument about the tails, note that for `|X| >> 1` and
  `|X| >> (|skewness| * tailweight)**tailweight`, we have
  `Y approx 0.5 X**tailweight e**(sign(X) skewness * tailweight)`.
