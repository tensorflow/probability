"""The Limited-Memory BFGS minimization algorithm.

Limited-memory quasi-Newton methods are useful for solving large problems
whose Hessian matrices cannot be computed at a reasonable cost or are not
sparse. Instead of storing fully dense n x n approximations of Hessian
matrices, they only save a few vectors of length n that represent the
approximations implicitly.

This module implements the algorithm known as L-BFGS, which, as its name
suggests, is a limited-memory version of the BFGS algorithm.

  Args:
    value_and_gradients_function:  A Python callable that accepts a point as a
      real `Tensor` and returns a tuple of `Tensor`s of real dtype containing
      the value of the function and its gradient at that point. The function
      to be minimized. The input is of shape `[..., n]`, where `n` is the size
      of the domain of input points, and all others are batching dimensions.
      The first component of the return value is a real `Tensor` of matching
      shape `[...]`. The second component (the gradient) is also of shape
      `[..., n]` like the input value to the function.
    initial_position: Real `Tensor` of shape `[..., n]`. The starting point, or
      points when using batching dimensions, of the search procedure. At these
      points the function value and the gradient norm should be finite.
    num_correction_pairs: Positive integer. Specifies the maximum number of
      (position_delta, gradient_delta) correction pairs to keep as implicit
      approximation of the Hessian matrix.
    tolerance: Scalar `Tensor` of real dtype. Specifies the gradient tolerance
      for the procedure. If the supremum norm of the gradient vector is below
      this number, the algorithm is stopped.
    x_tolerance: Scalar `Tensor` of real dtype. If the absolute change in the
      position between one iteration and the next is smaller than this number,
      the algorithm is stopped.
    f_relative_tolerance: Scalar `Tensor` of real dtype. If the relative change
      in the objective value between one iteration and the next is smaller
      than this value, the algorithm is stopped.
    initial_inverse_hessian_estimate: None. Option currently not supported.
    max_iterations: Scalar positive int32 `Tensor`. The maximum number of
      iterations for L-BFGS updates.
    parallel_iterations: Positive integer. The number of iterations allowed to
      run in parallel.
    stopping_condition: (Optional) A Python function that takes as input two
      Boolean tensors of shape `[...]`, and returns a Boolean scalar tensor.
      The input tensors are `converged` and `failed`, indicating the current
      status of each respective batch member; the return value states whether
      the algorithm should stop. The default is tfp.optimizer.converged_all
      which only stops when all batch members have either converged or failed.
      An alternative is tfp.optimizer.converged_any which stops as soon as one
      batch member has converged, or when all have failed.
    name: (Optional) Python str. The name prefixed to the ops created by this
      function. If not supplied, the default name 'minimize' is used.

  Returns:
    optimizer_results: A namedtuple containing the following items:
      converged: Scalar boolean tensor indicating whether the minimum was
        found within tolerance.
      failed:  Scalar boolean tensor indicating whether a line search
        step failed to find a suitable step size satisfying Wolfe
        conditions. In the absence of any constraints on the
        number of objective evaluations permitted, this value will
        be the complement of `converged`. However, if there is
        a constraint and the search stopped due to available
        evaluations being exhausted, both `failed` and `converged`
        will be simultaneously False.
      num_objective_evaluations: The total number of objective
        evaluations performed.
      position: A tensor containing the last argument value found
        during the search. If the search converged, then
        this value is the argmin of the objective function.
      objective_value: A tensor containing the value of the objective
        function at the `position`. If the search converged, then this is
        the (local) minimum of the objective function.
      objective_gradient: A tensor containing the gradient of the objective
        function at the `position`. If the search converged the
        max-norm of this tensor should be below the tolerance.
      position_deltas: A tensor encoding information about the latest
        changes in `position` during the algorithm execution.
      gradient_deltas: A tensor encoding information about the latest
        changes in `objective_gradient` during the algorithm execution.
