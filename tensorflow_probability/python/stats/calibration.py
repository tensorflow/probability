"""Calibration metrics for probabilistic predictions.

Calibration is a property of probabilistic prediction models: a model is said to
be well-calibrated if its predicted probabilities over a class of events match
long-term frequencies over the sampling distribution.

def brier_decomposition(labels, logits, name=None):
  r"""Decompose the Brier score into uncertainty, resolution, and reliability.

  [Proper scoring rules][1] measure the quality of probabilistic predictions;
  any proper scoring rule admits a [unique decomposition][2] as
  `Score = Uncertainty - Resolution + Reliability`, where:

  * `Uncertainty`, is a generalized entropy of the average predictive
    distribution; it can both be positive or negative.
  * `Resolution`, is a generalized variance of individual predictive
    distributions; it is always non-negative.  Difference in predictions reveal
    information, that is why a larger resolution improves the predictive score.
  * `Reliability`, a measure of calibration of predictions against the true
    frequency of events.  It is always non-negative and a lower value here
    indicates better calibration.

  This method estimates the above decomposition for the case of the Brier
  scoring rule for discrete outcomes.  For this, we need to discretize the space
  of probability distributions; we choose a simple partition of the space into
  `nlabels` events: given a distribution `p` over `nlabels` outcomes, the index
  `k` for which `p_k > p_i` for all `i != k` determines the discretization
  outcome; that is, `p in M_k`, where `M_k` is the set of all distributions for
  which `p_k` is the largest value among all probabilities.

  The estimation error of each component is O(k/n), where n is the number
  of instances and k is the number of labels.  There may be an error of this
  order when compared to `brier_score`.

def brier_score(labels, logits, name=None):
  r"""Compute Brier score for a probabilistic prediction.

  The [Brier score][1] is a loss function for probabilistic predictions over a
  number of discrete outcomes.  For a probability vector `p` and a realized
  outcome `k` the Brier score is `sum_i p[i]*p[i] - 2*p[k]`.  Smaller values are
  better in terms of prediction quality.  The Brier score can be negative.

  Compared to the cross entropy (aka logarithmic scoring rule) the Brier score
  does not strongly penalize events which are deemed unlikely but do occur,
  see [2].  The Brier score is a strictly proper scoring rule and therefore
  yields consistent probabilistic predictions.
