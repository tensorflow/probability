  """The (diagonal) SinhArcsinh transformation of a distribution on `R^k`.

  This distribution models a random vector `Y = (Y1,...,Yk)`, making use of
  a `SinhArcsinh` transformation (which has adjustable tailweight and skew),
  a rescaling, and a shift.

  The `SinhArcsinh` transformation of the Normal is described in great depth in
  [Sinh-arcsinh distributions](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27798865).
  Here we use a slightly different parameterization, in terms of `tailweight`
  and `skewness`.  Additionally we allow for distributions other than Normal,
  and control over `scale` as well as a "shift" parameter `loc`.

  #### Mathematical Details

  Given iid random vector `Z = (Z1,...,Zk)`, we define the VectorSinhArcsinhDiag
  transformation of `Z`, `Y`, parameterized by
  `(loc, scale, skewness, tailweight)`, via the relation (with `@` denoting
  matrix multiplication):

  ```
  Y := loc + scale @ F(Z) * (2 / F_0(2))
  F(Z) := Sinh( (Arcsinh(Z) + skewness) * tailweight )
  F_0(Z) := Sinh( Arcsinh(Z) * tailweight )
  ```

  This distribution is similar to the location-scale transformation
  `L(Z) := loc + scale @ Z` in the following ways:

  * If `skewness = 0` and `tailweight = 1` (the defaults), `F(Z) = Z`, and then
    `Y = L(Z)` exactly.
  * `loc` is used in both to shift the result by a constant factor.
  * The multiplication of `scale` by `2 / F_0(2)` ensures that if `skewness = 0`
    `P[Y - loc <= 2 * scale] = P[L(Z) - loc <= 2 * scale]`.
    Thus it can be said that the weights in the tails of `Y` and `L(Z)` beyond
    `loc + 2 * scale` are the same.

  This distribution is different than `loc + scale @ Z` due to the
  reshaping done by `F`:

  * Positive (negative) `skewness` leads to positive (negative) skew.
    * positive skew means, the mode of `F(Z)` is "tilted" to the right.
    * positive skew means positive values of `F(Z)` become more likely, and
      negative values become less likely.
  * Larger (smaller) `tailweight` leads to fatter (thinner) tails.
    * Fatter tails mean larger values of `|F(Z)|` become more likely.
    * `tailweight < 1` leads to a distribution that is "flat" around `Y = loc`,
      and a very steep drop-off in the tails.
    * `tailweight > 1` leads to a distribution more peaked at the mode with
      heavier tails.

  To see the argument about the tails, note that for `|Z| >> 1` and
  `|Z| >> (|skewness| * tailweight)**tailweight`, we have
  `Y approx 0.5 Z**tailweight e**(sign(Z) skewness * tailweight)`.

  To see the argument regarding multiplying `scale` by `2 / F_0(2)`,

  ```
  P[(Y - loc) / scale <= 2] = P[F(Z) * (2 / F_0(2)) <= 2]
                            = P[F(Z) <= F_0(2)]
                            = P[Z <= 2]  (if F = F_0).
  ```

    """Construct VectorSinhArcsinhDiag distribution on `R^k`.

    The arguments `scale_diag` and `scale_identity_multiplier` combine to
    define the diagonal `scale` referred to in this class docstring:

    ```none
    scale = diag(scale_diag + scale_identity_multiplier * ones(k))
    ```

    The `batch_shape` is the broadcast shape between `loc` and `scale`
    arguments.

    The `event_shape` is given by last dimension of the matrix implied by
    `scale`. The last dimension of `loc` (if provided) must broadcast with this

    Additional leading dimensions (if any) will index batches.

    Args:
      loc: Floating-point `Tensor`. If this is set to `None`, `loc` is
        implicitly `0`. When specified, may have shape `[B1, ..., Bb, k]` where
        `b >= 0` and `k` is the event size.
      scale_diag: Non-zero, floating-point `Tensor` representing a diagonal
        matrix added to `scale`. May have shape `[B1, ..., Bb, k]`, `b >= 0`,
        and characterizes `b`-batches of `k x k` diagonal matrices added to
        `scale`. When both `scale_identity_multiplier` and `scale_diag` are
        `None` then `scale` is the `Identity`.
      scale_identity_multiplier: Non-zero, floating-point `Tensor` representing
        a scale-identity-matrix added to `scale`. May have shape
        `[B1, ..., Bb]`, `b >= 0`, and characterizes `b`-batches of scale
        `k x k` identity matrices added to `scale`. When both
        `scale_identity_multiplier` and `scale_diag` are `None` then `scale`
        is the `Identity`.
      skewness:  Skewness parameter.  floating-point `Tensor` with shape
        broadcastable with `event_shape`.
      tailweight:  Tailweight parameter.  floating-point `Tensor` with shape
        broadcastable with `event_shape`.
      distribution: `tf.Distribution`-like instance. Distribution from which `k`
        iid samples are used as input to transformation `F`.  Default is
        `tfd.Normal(loc=0., scale=1.)`.
        Must be a scalar-batch, scalar-event distribution.  Typically
        `distribution.reparameterization_type = FULLY_REPARAMETERIZED` or it is
        a function of non-trainable parameters. WARNING: If you backprop through
        a VectorSinhArcsinhDiag sample and `distribution` is not
        `FULLY_REPARAMETERIZED` yet is a function of trainable variables, then
        the gradient will be incorrect!
      validate_args: Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution
        parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime
        performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect
        outputs.
      allow_nan_stats: Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`,
        statistics (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to
        indicate the result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised
        if one or more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.
      name: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.

    Raises:
      ValueError: if at most `scale_identity_multiplier` is specified.
