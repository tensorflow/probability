  If one KL method is registered between any pairs of classes in these two
  parent hierarchies, it is used.

  If more than one such registered method exists, the method whose registered
  classes have the shortest sum MRO paths to the input types is used.

  If more than one such shortest path exists, the first method
  identified in the search is used (favoring a shorter MRO distance to
  `type(distribution_a)`).
