  """The SinhArcsinh transformation of a distribution on `(-inf, inf)`.

  This distribution models a random variable, making use of
  a `SinhArcsinh` transformation (which has adjustable tailweight and skew),
  a rescaling, and a shift.

  The `SinhArcsinh` transformation of the Normal is described in great depth in
  [Sinh-arcsinh distributions](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27798865).
  Here we use a slightly different parameterization, in terms of `tailweight`
  and `skewness`.  Additionally we allow for distributions other than Normal,
  and control over `scale` as well as a "shift" parameter `loc`.

  #### Mathematical Details

  Given random variable `Z`, we define the SinhArcsinh
  transformation of `Z`, `Y`, parameterized by
  `(loc, scale, skewness, tailweight)`, via the relation:

  ```
  Y := loc + scale * F(Z) * (2 / F_0(2))
  F(Z) := Sinh( (Arcsinh(Z) + skewness) * tailweight )
  F_0(Z) := Sinh( Arcsinh(Z) * tailweight )
  ```

  This distribution is similar to the location-scale transformation
  `L(Z) := loc + scale * Z` in the following ways:

  * If `skewness = 0` and `tailweight = 1` (the defaults), `F(Z) = Z`, and then
    `Y = L(Z)` exactly.
  * `loc` is used in both to shift the result by a constant factor.
  * The multiplication of `scale` by `2 / F_0(2)` ensures that if `skewness = 0`
    `P[Y - loc <= 2 * scale] = P[L(Z) - loc <= 2 * scale]`.
    Thus it can be said that the weights in the tails of `Y` and `L(Z)` beyond
    `loc + 2 * scale` are the same.

  This distribution is different than `loc + scale * Z` due to the
  reshaping done by `F`:

  * Positive (negative) `skewness` leads to positive (negative) skew.
    * positive skew means, the mode of `F(Z)` is "tilted" to the right.
    * positive skew means positive values of `F(Z)` become more likely, and
      negative values become less likely.
  * Larger (smaller) `tailweight` leads to fatter (thinner) tails.
    * Fatter tails mean larger values of `|F(Z)|` become more likely.
    * `tailweight < 1` leads to a distribution that is "flat" around `Y = loc`,
      and a very steep drop-off in the tails.
    * `tailweight > 1` leads to a distribution more peaked at the mode with
      heavier tails.

  To see the argument about the tails, note that for `|Z| >> 1` and
  `|Z| >> (|skewness| * tailweight)**tailweight`, we have
  `Y approx 0.5 Z**tailweight e**(sign(Z) skewness * tailweight)`.

  To see the argument regarding multiplying `scale` by `2 / F_0(2)`,

  ```
  P[(Y - loc) / scale <= 2] = P[F(Z) * (2 / F_0(2)) <= 2]
                            = P[F(Z) <= F_0(2)]
                            = P[Z <= 2]  (if F = F_0).
  ```

    Arguments `(loc, scale, skewness, tailweight)` must have broadcastable shape

    Args:
      loc: Floating-point `Tensor`.
      scale:  `Tensor` of same `dtype` as `loc`.
      skewness:  Skewness parameter.  Default is `0.0` (no skew).
      tailweight:  Tailweight parameter. Default is `1.0` (unchanged tailweight)
      distribution: `tf.Distribution`-like instance. Distribution that is
        transformed to produce this distribution.
        Default is `tfd.Normal(0., 1.)`.
        Must be a scalar-batch, scalar-event distribution.  Typically
        `distribution.reparameterization_type = FULLY_REPARAMETERIZED` or it is
        a function of non-trainable parameters. WARNING: If you backprop through
        a `SinhArcsinh` sample and `distribution` is not
        `FULLY_REPARAMETERIZED` yet is a function of trainable variables, then
        the gradient will be incorrect!
      validate_args: Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution
        parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime
        performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect
        outputs.
      allow_nan_stats: Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`,
        statistics (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to
        indicate the result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised
        if one or more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.
