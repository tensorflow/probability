    # determinant exceeds some bound (rationale for bound forthwith).
    # - This is a (convex!) shape in dim * (dim - 1) / 2 dimensions
    #   (because a correlation matrix is determined by its lower
    #   triangle, and the main diagonal is all 1s).
    # - Further, M is contained entirely in the [-1,1] cube,
    #   because no correlation can fall outside that interval.
    #
    # We have two different ways to estimate the volume of M:
    # - Importance sampling from the LKJ distribution
    # - Importance sampling from the uniform distribution on the cube
    #
    # This test checks that these two methods agree.  However, because
    # the uniform proposal leads to many rejections (thus slowness),
    # those volumes are computed offline and the confidence intervals
    # are presented to this test procedure in the "volume_bounds"
    # table.
    #
    # Why place a lower bound on the determinant?  Because for eta > 1,
    # the density of LKJ approaches 0 as the determinant approaches 0.
    # However, the test methodology requires an upper bound on the
    # improtance weights produced.  Rejecting matrices with too-small
    # determinant (from both methods) allows me to supply that bound.
    #
    # I considered several alternative regions whose volume I might
    # know analytically (without having to do rejection).
    # - Option a: Some hypersphere guaranteed to be contained inside M.
    #   - Con: I don't know a priori how to find a radius for it.
    #   - Con: I still need a lower bound on the determinants that appear
    #     in this sphere, and I don't know how to compute it.
    # - Option b: Some trapezoid given as the convex hull of the
    #   nearly-extreme correlation matrices (i.e., those that partition
    #   the variables into two strongly anti-correclated groups).
    #   - Con: Would have to dig up n-d convex hull code to implement this.
    #   - Con: Need to compute the volume of that convex hull.
    #   - Con: Need a bound on the determinants of the matrices in that hull.
    # - Option c: Same thing, but with the matrices that make a single pair
    #   of variables strongly correlated (or anti-correlated), and leaves
    #   the others uncorrelated.
    #   - Same cons, except that there is a determinant bound (which
    #     felt pretty loose).
