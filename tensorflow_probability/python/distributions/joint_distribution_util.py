  """Turns a (potentially nested) structure of dists into a single dist.

  Args:
    structure_of_distributions: instance of `tfd.Distribution`, or nested
      structure (tuple, list, dict, etc.) in which all leaves are
      `tfd.Distribution` instances.
    batch_ndims: Optional integer `Tensor` number of leftmost batch dimensions
      shared across all members of the input structure. If this is specified,
      the returned joint distribution will be an autobatched distribution with
      the given batch rank, and all other dimensions absorbed into the event.
    validate_args: Python `bool`. Whether the joint distribution should validate
      input with asserts. This imposes a runtime cost. If `validate_args` is
      `False`, and the inputs are invalid, correct behavior is not guaranteed.
      Default value: `False`.
  Returns:
    distribution: instance of `tfd.Distribution` such that
      `distribution.sample()` is equivalent to
      `tf.nest.map_structure(lambda d: d.sample(), structure_of_distributions)`.
      If `structure_of_distributions` was indeed a structure (as opposed to
      a single `Distribution` instance), this will be a `JointDistribution`
      with the corresponding structure.
  Raises:
    TypeError: if any leaves of the input structure are not `tfd.Distribution`
      instances.
