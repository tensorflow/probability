# TODO(b/116482987): Expose this distribution in TFP.
class _VectorStudentT(transformed_distribution.TransformedDistribution):
  """A vector version of Student's t-distribution on `R^k`.

  #### Mathematical details

  The probability density function (pdf) is,

  ```none
  pdf(x; df, mu, Sigma) = (1 + ||y||**2 / df)**(-0.5 (df + 1)) / Z
  where,
  y = inv(Sigma) (x - mu)
  Z = abs(det(Sigma)) ( sqrt(df pi) Gamma(0.5 df) / Gamma(0.5 (df + 1)) )**k
  ```

  where:
  * `loc = mu`; a vector in `R^k`,
  * `scale = Sigma`; a lower-triangular matrix in `R^{k x k}`,
  * `Z` denotes the normalization constant, and,
  * `Gamma` is the [gamma function](
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function), and,
  * `||y||**2` denotes the [squared Euclidean norm](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm) of `y`.

  The VectorStudentT distribution is a member of the [location-scale family](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location-scale_family), i.e., it can be
  constructed as,

  ```none
  X ~ StudentT(df, loc=0, scale=1)
  Y = loc + scale * X
  ```

  Notice that the `scale` matrix has semantics closer to std. deviation than
  covariance (but it is not std. deviation).

  This distribution is an Affine transformation of iid
  [Student's t-distributions](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution)
  and should not be confused with the [Multivariate Student's t-distribution](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_t-distribution). The
  traditional Multivariate Student's t-distribution is type of
  [elliptical distribution](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_distribution); it has PDF:

  ```none
  pdf(x; df, mu, Sigma) = (1 + ||y||**2 / df)**(-0.5 (df + k)) / Z
  where,
  y = inv(Sigma) (x - mu)
  Z = abs(det(Sigma)) sqrt(df pi)**k Gamma(0.5 df) / Gamma(0.5 (df + k))
  ```

  Notice that the Multivariate Student's t-distribution uses `k` where the
  Vector Student's t-distribution has a `1`. Conversely the Vector version has a
  broader application of the power-`k` in the normalization constant.

  #### Examples

  A single instance of a "Vector Student's t-distribution" is defined by a mean
  vector of length `k` and a scale matrix of shape `k x k`.

  Extra leading dimensions, if provided, allow for batches.

  ```python
  tfd = tfp.distributions

  # Initialize a single 3-variate vector Student's t-distribution.
  mu = [1., 2, 3]
  chol = [[1., 0, 0.],
          [1, 3, 0],
          [1, 2, 3]]
  vt = tfd.VectorStudentT(df=2, loc=mu, scale_tril=chol)

  # Evaluate this on an observation in R^3, returning a scalar.
  vt.prob([-1., 0, 1])

  # Initialize a batch of two 3-variate vector Student's t-distributions.
  mu = [[1., 2, 3],
        [11, 22, 33]]
  chol = ...  # shape 2 x 3 x 3, lower triangular, positive diagonal.
  vt = tfd.VectorStudentT(loc=mu, scale_tril=chol)

  # Evaluate this on a two observations, each in R^3, returning a length two
  # tensor.
  x = [[-1, 0, 1],
       [-11, 0, 11]]
  vt.prob(x)
  ```

  For more examples of how to construct the `scale` matrix, see the
  `tfp.bijectors.Affine` docstring.

    The `batch_shape` is the broadcast between `df.batch_shape` and
    `Affine.batch_shape` where `Affine` is constructed from `loc` and
    `scale_*` arguments.

    The `event_shape` is the event shape of `Affine.event_shape`.

    Args:
      df: Floating-point `Tensor`. The degrees of freedom of the
        distribution(s). `df` must contain only positive values. Must be
        scalar if `loc`, `scale_*` imply non-scalar batch_shape or must have the
        same `batch_shape` implied by `loc`, `scale_*`.
      loc: Floating-point `Tensor`. If this is set to `None`, no `loc` is
        applied.
      scale_identity_multiplier: floating point rank 0 `Tensor` representing a
        scaling done to the identity matrix. When `scale_identity_multiplier =
        scale_diag=scale_tril = None` then `scale += IdentityMatrix`. Otherwise
        no scaled-identity-matrix is added to `scale`.
      scale_diag: Floating-point `Tensor` representing the diagonal matrix.
        `scale_diag` has shape [N1, N2, ..., k], which represents a k x k
        diagonal matrix. When `None` no diagonal term is added to `scale`.
      scale_tril: Floating-point `Tensor` representing the diagonal matrix.
        `scale_diag` has shape [N1, N2, ..., k, k], which represents a k x k
        lower triangular matrix. When `None` no `scale_tril` term is added to
        `scale`. The upper triangular elements above the diagonal are ignored.
      scale_perturb_factor: Floating-point `Tensor` representing factor matrix
        with last two dimensions of shape `(k, r)`. When `None`, no rank-r
        update is added to `scale`.
      scale_perturb_diag: Floating-point `Tensor` representing the diagonal
        matrix. `scale_perturb_diag` has shape [N1, N2, ..., r], which
        represents an r x r Diagonal matrix. When `None` low rank updates will
        take the form `scale_perturb_factor * scale_perturb_factor.T`.
      validate_args: Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution
        parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime
        performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect
        outputs.
      allow_nan_stats: Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`,
        statistics (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to
        indicate the result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised
        if one or more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.
