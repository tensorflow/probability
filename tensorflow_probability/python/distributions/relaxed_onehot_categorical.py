class ExpRelaxedOneHotCategorical(distribution.Distribution):
  """ExpRelaxedOneHotCategorical distribution with temperature and logits.

  An ExpRelaxedOneHotCategorical distribution is a log-transformed
  RelaxedOneHotCategorical distribution. The RelaxedOneHotCategorical is a
  distribution over random probability vectors, vectors of positive real
  values that sum to one, which continuously approximates a OneHotCategorical.
  The degree of approximation is controlled by a temperature: as the temperature
  goes to 0 the RelaxedOneHotCategorical becomes discrete with a distribution
  described by the logits, as the temperature goes to infinity the
  RelaxedOneHotCategorical becomes the constant distribution that is identically
  the constant vector of (1/event_size, ..., 1/event_size).

  Because computing log-probabilities of the RelaxedOneHotCategorical can
  suffer from underflow issues, this class is one solution for loss
  functions that depend on log-probabilities, such as the KL Divergence found
  in the variational autoencoder loss. The KL divergence between two
  distributions is invariant under invertible transformations, so evaluating
  KL divergences of ExpRelaxedOneHotCategorical samples, which are always
  followed by a `tf.exp` op, is equivalent to evaluating KL divergences of
  RelaxedOneHotCategorical samples. See the appendix of Maddison et al., 2016
  for more mathematical details, where this distribution is called the
  ExpConcrete.

  #### Examples

  Creates a continuous distribution, whose exp approximates a 3-class one-hot
  categorical distribution. The 2nd class is the most likely to be the
  largest component in samples drawn from this distribution. If those samples
  are followed by a `tf.exp` op, then they are distributed as a relaxed onehot
  categorical.

  ```python
  temperature = 0.5
  p = [0.1, 0.5, 0.4]
  dist = ExpRelaxedOneHotCategorical(temperature, probs=p)
  samples = dist.sample()
  exp_samples = tf.exp(samples)
  # exp_samples has the same distribution as samples from
  # RelaxedOneHotCategorical(temperature, probs=p)
  ```

  Creates a continuous distribution, whose exp approximates a 3-class one-hot
  categorical distribution. The 2nd class is the most likely to be the
  largest component in samples drawn from this distribution.

  ```python
  temperature = 0.5
  logits = [-2, 2, 0]
  dist = ExpRelaxedOneHotCategorical(temperature, logits=logits)
  samples = dist.sample()
  exp_samples = tf.exp(samples)
  # exp_samples has the same distribution as samples from
  # RelaxedOneHotCategorical(temperature, probs=p)
  ```

  Creates a continuous distribution, whose exp approximates a 3-class one-hot
  categorical distribution. Because the temperature is very low, samples from
  this distribution are almost discrete, with one component almost 0 and the
  others very negative. The 2nd class is the most likely to be the largest
  component in samples drawn from this distribution.

  ```python
  temperature = 1e-5
  logits = [-2, 2, 0]
  dist = ExpRelaxedOneHotCategorical(temperature, logits=logits)
  samples = dist.sample()
  exp_samples = tf.exp(samples)
  # exp_samples has the same distribution as samples from
  # RelaxedOneHotCategorical(temperature, probs=p)
  ```

  Creates a continuous distribution, whose exp approximates a 3-class one-hot
  categorical distribution. Because the temperature is very high, samples from
  this distribution are usually close to the (-log(3), -log(3), -log(3)) vector.
  The 2nd class is still the most likely to be the largest component
  in samples drawn from this distribution.

  ```python
  temperature = 10
  logits = [-2, 2, 0]
  dist = ExpRelaxedOneHotCategorical(temperature, logits=logits)
  samples = dist.sample()
  exp_samples = tf.exp(samples)
  # exp_samples has the same distribution as samples from
  # RelaxedOneHotCategorical(temperature, probs=p)
  ```

  The RelaxedOneHotCategorical is a distribution over random probability

  approximates a OneHotCategorical. The degree of approximation is controlled by

  The RelaxedOneHotCategorical distribution was concurrently introduced as the
  Gumbel-Softmax (Jang et al., 2016) and Concrete (Maddison et al., 2016)
  distributions for use as a reparameterized continuous approximation to the
  `Categorical` one-hot distribution. If you use this distribution, please cite
  both papers.
