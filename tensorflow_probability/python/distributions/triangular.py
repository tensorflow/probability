  r"""Triangular distribution with `low`, `high` and `peak` parameters.

  #### Mathematical Details

  The Triangular distribution is specified by two line segments in the plane,
  such that:

    * The first line segment starts at `(a, 0)` and ends at `(c, z)`.
    * The second line segment starts at `(c, z)` and ends at `(b, 0)`.

    ```none
    y

    ^
  z |           o  (c,z)
    |          / \
    |         /   \
    |        /     \
    | (a,0) /       \ (b,0)
  0 +------o---------o-------> x
    0      a    c    b
  ```

  where:
  * a <= c <= b, a < b
  * `low = a`,
  * `high = b`,
  * `peak = c`,
  * `z = 2 / (b - a)`

  The parameters `low`, `high` and `peak` must be shaped in a way that supports
  broadcasting (e.g., `high - low` is a valid operation).

  #### Examples

  ```python
  import tensorflow_probability as tfp
  tfd = tfp.distributions

  # Specify a single Triangular distribution.
  u1 = tfd.Triangular(low=3., high=4., peak=3.5)
  u1.mean()
  # ==> 3.5

  # Specify two different Triangular distributions.
  u2 = tfd.Triangular(low=[1., 2.], high=[3., 4.], peak=[2., 3.])
  u2.mean()
  # ==> [2., 3.]

  # Specify three different Triangular distributions by leveraging broadcasting.
  u3 = tfd.Triangular(low=3., high=[5., 6., 7.], peak=3.)
  u3.mean()
  # ==> [3.6666, 4., 4.3333]
  ```
