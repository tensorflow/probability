class JointDistributionCoroutine(joint_distribution_lib.JointDistribution):
  """Joint distribution parameterized by a distribution-making generator.

  This distribution enables both sampling and joint probability computation from
  a single model specification.

  A joint distribution is a collection of possibly interdependent distributions.
  The `JointDistributionCoroutine` is specified by a generator that
  generates the elements of this collection.

  #### Mathematical Details

  The `JointDistributionCoroutine` implements the chain rule of probability.
  That is, the probability function of a length-`d` vector `x` is,

  ```none
  p(x) = prod{ p(x[i] | x[:i]) : i = 0, ..., (d - 1) }
  ```

  The `JointDistributionCoroutine` is parameterized by a generator
  that yields `tfp.distributions.Distribution`-like instances.

  Each element yielded implements the `i`-th *full conditional distribution*,
  `p(x[i] | x[:i])`. Within the generator, the return value from the yield
  is a sample from the distribution that may be used to construct subsequent
  yielded `Distribution`-like instances. This allows later instances
  to be conditional on earlier ones.

  When the `sample` method for a `JointDistributionCoroutine` is called with
  a `sample_shape`, the `sample` method for each of the yielded
  distributions is called.
  The distributions that have been wrapped in the
  `JointDistributionCoroutine.Root` class will be called with `sample_shape` as
  the `sample_shape` argument, and the unwrapped distributions
  will be called with `()` as the `sample_shape` argument.

  It is the user's responsibility to ensure that
  each of the distributions generates samples with the specified sample
  size.

  **Name resolution**: The names of `JointDistributionCoroutine` components
  may be specified by passing `name` arguments to distribution constructors (
  `tfd.Normal(0., 1., name='x')). Components without an explicit name will be
  assigned a dummy name.

  #### Examples

  ```python
  tfd = tfp.distributions

  # Consider the following generative model:
  #     e ~ Exponential(rate=[100, 120])
  #     g ~ Gamma(concentration=e[0], rate=e[1])
  #     n ~ Normal(loc=0, scale=2.)
  #     m ~ Normal(loc=n, scale=g)

  # In TFP, we can write this as:
  Root = tfd.JointDistributionCoroutine.Root  # Convenient alias.
  def model():
    e = yield Root(tfd.Independent(tfd.Exponential(rate=[100, 120]), 1))
    g = yield tfd.Gamma(concentration=e[..., 0], rate=e[..., 1])
    n = yield Root(tfd.Normal(loc=0, scale=2.))
    m = yield tfd.Normal(loc=n, scale=g)

  joint = tfd.JointDistributionCoroutine(model)

  x = joint.sample()
  # ==> x is A length-4 tuple of Tensors representing a draw/realization from
  #     each distribution.
  joint.log_prob(x)
  # ==> A scalar `Tensor` representing the total log prob under all four
  #     distributions.
  ```

  #### Discussion

  Each element yielded by the generator must be a `tfd.Distribution`-like
  instance.

  An object is deemed '`tfd.Distribution`-like' if it has a
  `sample`, `log_prob`, and distribution properties, e.g., `batch_shape`,
  `event_shape`, `dtype`.

  Consider the following fragment from a generator:

  ```python
    n = yield Root(tfd.Normal(loc=0, scale=2.))
    m = yield tfd.Normal(loc=n, scale=1.0)
  ```

  The random variable `n` has no dependence on earlier random variables and
  `Root` is used to indicate that its distribution needs to be passed a
  `sample_shape`. On the other hand, the distribution of `m` is constructed
  using the value of `n`. This means that `n` is already shaped according to
  the `sample_shape` and there is no need to pass `m`'s distribution a
  `sample_size`. So `Root` is not used to wrap `m`'s distribution.

  **Note**: unlike most other distributions in `tfp.distributions`,
  `JointDistributionCoroutine.sample` returns a `tuple` of `Tensor`s
  rather than a `Tensor`.  Accordingly `joint.batch_shape` returns a
  `tuple` of `TensorShape`s for each of the distributions' batch shapes
  and `joint.batch_shape_tensor()` returns a `tuple` of `Tensor`s for
  each of the distributions' event shapes. (Same with `event_shape` analogues.)
