  """A non-identifiable model with a quartic measurement model.

  This distribution is defined in [1] as the posterior induced by the following
  model:

  ```none
  for i in range(ndims):
    theta[i] ~ Normal(loc=0, scale=1)
  F(theta) = theta[1]**2 + 3 * theta[0]**2 * (theta[0]**2 - 1)
  y ~ Normal(loc=F(theta), scale=noise_scale)
  ```

  with an observed `y = 1`. Note that if `ndims` is > 2, the additional
  dimensions are distributed as a standard normal.

  This distribution is notable for having density on a narrow manifold which
  requires small step sizes when using HMC. It also happens to be multi-modal (4
  modes), but the modes are not well separated and should not pose challenge to
  most inference methods.
