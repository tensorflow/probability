  """Creates a funnel-shaped distribution.

  This distribution was first described in [1]. The distribution is constructed
  by transforming a N-D gaussian with scale [3, 1, ...] by scaling all but the
  first dimensions by `exp(x0 / 2)` where  `x0` is the value of the first
  dimension.

  ```none
  x[0] ~ Normal(loc=0, scale=3)
  for i in range(1, ndims):
    x[i] ~ Normal(loc=0, scale=exp(x[0] / 2))
  ```

  This distribution is notable for having a relatively narrow "neck" region
  which is challenging for HMC to explore. This distribution resembles the
  posteriors of centrally parameterized hierarchical models.
