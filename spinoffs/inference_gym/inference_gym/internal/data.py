        county in which each house is located (the `Tensor` will have
        `num_counties` unique values). This represents the contextual effect.

  This dataset is a simulation of 400 students each answering a subset of
  100 unique questions, with a total of 30012 questions answered.

  The dataset is split into train and test portions by randomly partitioning the
  student-question-response triplets. This has two consequences. First, the
  student and question ids are shared between test and train sets. Second, there
  is a possibility of some students or questions not being present in both sets.

  The train set will contain `num_train_points = int(train_fraction * 30012)`

  The triples are encoded into three parallel arrays per set. I.e.

  `*_question_ids[i]` correctly; `*_correct[i] == 0` means they didn't.
