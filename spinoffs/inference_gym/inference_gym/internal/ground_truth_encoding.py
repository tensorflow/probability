"""Functions to encode/decode ground truth into Python sources.

Sample transformation ground truth is composed of up to 4 quantities (mean,
standard deviation and standard errors of both), each of which can be a nested
structure of Numpy arrays. We encode them using global variables via
the `array_to_source` utility.  We derive the names of these global variables
as follows:

```none
constant_name ::= transformation_name [ "_" tuple_path ] "_"
                  quantity_name

tuple_path = path_component [ "_" path_component ]*

quantity_name ::= "MEAN" | "MEAN_STANDARD_ERROR" |
                  "STANDARD_DEVIATION" | "STANDARD_DEVIATION_STANDARD_ERROR"
```

Here `transfomation_name` is the name of the sample transfromation.
`tuple_path` is the tuple path (as defined by `nest.flatten_with_tuple_paths`)
of the relevant part of the nested ground truth quantity. `quantity_name` is one
of the 4 supported quantities. The global variable name is upper-cased to
conform to style guidelines. The ground truth file is allowed to omit unknown
quantities.

#### Examples

##### A non-nested ground truth.

```
name = "test"
mean_value = 3.
```

is encoded (modulo the encoding used by `array_to_source`) as:

```
TEST_MEAN = 3.
```

##### Nested ground truth.

```
name = "test"
mean_value = [1., {'b': 2.}]
```

is encoded (modulo the encoding used by `array_to_source`) as:

```
TEST_0_MEAN = 1.
TEST_1_B_MEAN = 2.
```
