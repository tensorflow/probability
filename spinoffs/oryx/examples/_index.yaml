        Oryx's approach is to expose a set of function transformations that
        compose and integrate with JAX's existing transformations. To install Oryx,
        you can run:

        <pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy prettyprint lang-shell">
        pip install --upgrade oryx
        </pre>
      code_block: |
        <pre class = "prettyprint">
        import oryx
        import jax.numpy as jnp
        ppl = oryx.core.ppl
        tfd = oryx.distributions

        # Define sampling function
        def sample(key):
          x = ppl.random_variable(tfd.Normal(0., 1.))(key)
          return jnp.exp(x / 2.) + 2.

        # Transform sampling function into a log-density function
        ppl.log_prob(sample)(1.)  # ==> -0.9189
