"""Registers custom rules for neural networks in the stateful function API.

The Oryx state API enables having a custom unzip rules when `init`-ing a
function. We use this for neural networks to thread kwargs through the Jaxpr
that is created when unzipping a function. This module implements this by first
replacing instances of `layer_cau` with a `FlatPrimitive`s, which avoids
using a call primitive, which we would be difficult to pass new keyword
arguments into. We can more easily override the behavior of a regular primitive.
