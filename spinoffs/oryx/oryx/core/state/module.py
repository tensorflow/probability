class Module(pytree.Pytree, metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
  """Encapsulates a parameterized function, along with updates to its state.

  Modules have the dual purpose of acting as containers for state and as
  functions of that state.

  As containers, a Module's `variables()` method returns any encapsulated state,
  and its `flatten` and `unflatten` method are used to register it as a Pytree,
  so that it can be passed in and out of JAX-transformed functions. For example,
  if we have a neural network layer module `layer`, then `layer.variables()`
  returns the weights of the layer and `grad(some_f)(layer)` returns the
  gradient of `some_f` with respect to those weights.

  As functions, a `Module` has three methods: `call`, `update`, and
  `call_and_update`. Conceptually a `Module` represents a parameterized function
  `f_variables(inputs)`, and its `call` method computes the output of the
  function. A module's `update` method returns a new copy of the module for
  a set of inputs with potentially new state (variables). The `call_and_update`
  method returns both the output of the function and an updated module.

  The `__call__` method has some extra logic needed for composing stateful
  functions. If a module `m1` is called in the body of another module `m2`
  we would like `m2` to "inherit" the state in `m1`, so that either `m1`
  or `m1`'s variables appear in `m2`'s variables. If a module has a non-`None`
  `name`, then we'd like it to appear in `m2`'s variables with name `name`,
  and if not, we'd like variables in `m1` to appear in `m2` directly. To emulate
  this behavior, we have the `__call__` method call `assign` on the updated
  module (or its member variables) to appropriately update the state to an
  outer stateful context.
