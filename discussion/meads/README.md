# Tuning-Free Generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

The notebook meads.ipynb (best run via Google Colab or Jupyter) implements and
demonstrates the Maximum-Eigenvalue Adaptation of Damping and Step size (MEADS)
algorithm from the paper "Tuning-Free Generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo" (to
appear at AISTATS 2022).
